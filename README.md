Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method of analyzing datasets to understand their main characteristics. It involves summarizing data features, detecting patterns, and uncovering relationships through visual and statistical techniques. EDA helps in gaining insights and formulating hypotheses for further analysis.

The EDA process can involve several steps: loading the data, cleaning the data, plotting each variable, grouping variables, and plotting groups of variables.
